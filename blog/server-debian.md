# Self Hosting - Server Setup 

## Debian Stable

### Docker 

### Make

## Docker Compose

### Git (Version Control)

Taking a devops approach to self hosting is not complicated. What it means is having configurations stored in source control that can be automatically deployed or atleast saved. If we assume any server that runs docker could run the services as configured then we should be gold. Of course you still need to manage your data and backups.

Use whichever git service you like for hosting your private configuration but I do recommend using an external service from your own for this purpose.
