Got it working in VSCODE development container but just couldn't get it to build using Dockerfile.
Kept asking why was it so hard....


Go Modules was a missing piece for me.

Originally go was like javascript without npm.
Then npm was introduced and for javascritp and go modules was introduced to go.
