Unfortunately VBox Guest Additions don't automatically upgrade when a new version of Virtual Box is deployed.

New guest additions was mounted automatically by virtualbox with the new iso in this case

```
	cd /media/moon/VBox_GAs_6.1.12
	sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
```

This will build and install the new kernel modules.

Reboot.
