/pdf: checks the cache (filesystem) if it exists... serve it.
BUT MUST NOT request outside the /cache path!


Headless chrome Puppeteer node.

Node server....
Take request from http endpoint and make an http request of a web page.
Put the generated pdf into the cache or return the stream? I think put it to the cache and return to done to the initial request.
Node server needs to be a client... do client authentication to the api? and give that token to the chrome instance to use?
