Install ProphetX on PC !!! include excel add in !!!
Installed for 1 user only.
Setup PC to connect or Order Computer... we either have to set it up at the order desk or setup a virtual machine we can RDP into?


Model Implementation Notes:
-------------------------------------------------------

Startup ProphetX and login. (it must be running for model to receive up to date information).

Workbook Startup Macro: 
* Sets the Effective Date to today
* Locks the Dashboard spreadsheet

Futures to use is determined based on the Effective Date


* Add datatables to excel using the prophetx datatables
* Note:  If you move a table (a table is consider the results of your add-in request) or copy it, the index will change and you will no longer be able to go back and change the information using the double-click on the first column heading as described above.

Dashboard:
* Effective Date:
 * Very important to set the working date (typically this is set to today) 
 * Maybe it should ALWAYS be set to today?
 
* CME LHF are listed on the dashboard
 * The 10 CME LHF subsequent to the effective date are on the dashboard
 * The LHF MUST be registered on the LHFutures tab (THEY MUST BE IN ORDER OF EXPIRATION)
 * LAST prices are looked up on the LHQuotes tab by the ProphetX code
 * Prices can be overriden (manually)
 - Prices should be automatically overriden for publishing opening or closing prices

* Macros on the Dashboard Sheet for week selection
 

Dates Generation:
* Dates Generation creates weeks 4 to 52 starting from the effective date are on the dashboard

Register:
* Registration of CME Lean Hog Futures, Month, Description and Symbols for lookups including ProphetX and Bloomberg
* Registration o CME Canadian Dollar Futures, Month, Description and Symbols for lookups including ProphetX and Bloomberg
* New Futures MUST be added to the tab as the time comes
* ProphetX Symbol and Bloomberg Symbol MUST be encoded registered for each Future
- it looks like we need to register the futures hear instead of using prophetx values for date lookups
 
LHQuotes:
* Connected to ProphetX showing the Open/Close High Low Last and Volume of trading on LHFutures
* ProphetX table MUST be maintained by adding additional futures as they become available

	BGN

	Bloomberg Generic prices (BGN) are a single-security composite derived from electronic dealer contribution. Both executable and indicative levels are considered.
	FXCM
	

 
 
Prices:
* This sheet should NOT be edited
* This sheet pulls the prices from the dashboard
 * which ones is derived on the sheet
* This sheet pulls the weeks from the date generation
* This sheet pulls data from Parameters
* This sheet pulls data from AvgDailyBasis
* This sheet pulls data from RiskFactor
   
 
 
 * Do we want the 1 month ago and 1 week ago prices in the model? I'd say no so I removed them.
 * What do we want to do about the FX Quotes?
