docker-compose... give the host and additional name... and ip map that way angular startup
we can set the host devobs and the public address also

    extra_hosts:
      - "${HOST_NAME}:${HOST_IP}"
	  
	  
	  
Binding this server to an open connection can result in compromising your application or


computer. 
Using a different host than the one passed to the "--host" flag might result in websocket connection issues. You might need to use "--disableHostCheck" if that's the case.


WARNING: Running a server with --disable-host-check is a security risk. See https://medium.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server-middleware-security-issues-1489d950874a for more information.
