Digital Ocean

Pipelines Fine. 

Having an issue swarm running out of swarm space.

Space - $5 a month for
Machine - 16 GB: 


Digital Ocean Droplet - Docker CE and Docker Compose
We don't need swarm or kubernetes... So to control updates on the droplet for automation!


Github or Bitbucket has the source code.

Agent watching Github or Bitbucket for Builds published to DockerHub Registry.
Dockerhub is the best place to build for the dockerregistry because it is ONTOP of the registry... in my opinion why push around built images.
So

Dockerhub 
- can it watch bitbucket
- can it watch github

New Images published to Dockerhub... now how do we update images on Digital Ocean
